# InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology WG (I-ADOPT)
[I-ADOPT](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg) is a Research Data Alliance Working Group launched in October 2019. The WG aims at creating a community-agreed framework for representing observable properties by bringing together groups that have been working on developing terminologies* to accurately encode what was measured, observed, derived, or computed.
